## Jotunheimr

HEY HEY, It's so long since the last article, right? I know, sorry super-busy.. as usual, Btw let's start 2024 with something great!!

I am in deep love with simplicity, complexity disgusts me.. It's shit, and that is the reason for crafting this package in the first place.

Playing with operating system is super fun, but making what you craft reusable, scalable, and developer-friendly, It's one of the skills that cannot be learned easily, only **VETERANS** own it, 

Instead of a long introduction, **What is that, and how I use it?**

## What is that?

I crafted an elegent-wrapper for CoreNFC framework, for ease of use, almost anything that comes my way becomes reusable, I hate wasting my time writing the same code over and over and over, the same as complexity.

Btw, this package currently owns four operations and one property.

- Jotunheimr 
    - Scan for tag 
        - Enabling scan mode and waiting to detect any NFC tag
- Jotunheimr Client
    - Properties:
        - Nfc Tag
            - Total Capacity:
                - return total tag capacity
            - Tag Status:
                - Return if It's supported, read only, or write and read.
    - Operations:
        - Get payloads
             - Get all messages and paylods saved In NFC tag
        - Add payload
            - Add a new payload to current messages.
        - Write payload
            - Write a new payload and delete previous messages.
## How to use it?

It's simple, add the package via Swift package manager.

```swift
https://github.com/shadyelmaadawy/Jotunheimr.git
```

Then add NFC read permission to Info.plist

```swift
    <key>NFCReaderUsageDescription</key>
    <string>NFC Reader Permission Usage Description </string>
```

Last thing, add near field communication tag reading to capabilities

Okaaaay, But how I read messages/payloads in the tag?
```swift
    import Jotunheimr
    let jotunheimr = Jotunheimr.shared
    func readRecords() async {
        
        do {
            
            let jotunheimrClient = try await jotunheimr.scanForTag(scanMessage: "Hello, Scan your tag!")
            let records: [NFCNDEFPayload] = try await jotunheimrClient.getPayloads()
            
        } catch {}
        
    }
```
Very simple, no magic, just two lines of code!

How I write a message/payload?

```swift
    import Jotunheimr
    let jotunheimr = Jotunheimr.shared
    func addPayload() async {
        
        do {
            
            let jotunheimrClient = try await jotunheimr.scanForTag(scanMessage: "Hello, Scan your tag!")
            // Default APPLE Implementation
            let nfcPayload = NFCNDEFPayload.init(
                format: NFCTypeNameFormat.nfcWellKnown,
                type: "T".data(using: .utf8)!,
                identifier: Data.init(count: 0),
                payload: "Hello-World!;".data(using: .utf8)!,
                chunkSize: 0
            )
            try await jotunheimrClient.addPayload(nfcPayload)
            
        } catch {}
        
    }
```

What if I want to override all messages?
```swift
    import Jotunheimr
    let jotunheimr = Jotunheimr.shared
    func overridePayloads() async {
        
        do {
            
            let jotunheimrClient = try await jotunheimr.scanForTag(scanMessage: "Hello, Scan your tag!")
            // Default APPLE Implementation
            let nfcPayload = NFCNDEFPayload.init(
                format: NFCTypeNameFormat.nfcWellKnown,
                type: "T".data(using: .utf8)!,
                identifier: Data.init(count: 0),
                payload: "Hello-World!;".data(using: .utf8)!,
                chunkSize: 0
            )
            try await jotunheimrClient.writePayload(nfcPayload)
           
        } catch {}
        
    }
```

The same with one word changed, Ù…Ø¨Ø­Ø¨Ø´ Ø§Ø¹Ù‚Ø¯ Ø§Ù„Ø¹Ø§Ù„Ù…, also it uses default APPLE implementation for payloads, maybe later I wrap it , but currently for simplicity use.

## To Infinity and beyond!

An example project is Included, you can try it, Btwâ€¦ I will support this project and add more features and more cool stuff, please if you find any bug, donâ€™t hesitate to report it, with all my love. âœ¨ðŸ’œ
